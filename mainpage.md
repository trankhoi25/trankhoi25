      Dr Titi Tang
    </h4>
    <p align="center">
      Dr Titi Tang founded the FMC alongside Dr Hoang Tran in 1992. Together they helped thousands of patients in Footscray, particularly Vietnamese patients who spoke minimal English and couldn't find GP that could effectively understand them. Born in Vietnam and came to Australia as a refugee alongside her parents and younger brother, Dr Titi Tang climbed up the social ladder and achieved top marks in her academy studies to reach the position she is currently in.

      Dr Hoang Tran was born in Vietnam and came to Australia to complete his studies in medicine. After meeting Dr Titi Tang in university, the two of them decided that they should start their own clinic in Footscray to help service the Vietnamese population that live there
